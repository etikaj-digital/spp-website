Tim is a New Zealand-trained musculoskeletal physiotherapist with 8 years of experience working in both corporate and military sectors. He has worked on complex rehabilitation with both the general public and corporate clients with Habit Health and Fitness in Wellington, and on context-specific rehabilitation for Sailors and Aircrew for the NZDF.  

He focuses on identifying underlying conditions that lead to injury and overuse, including breathing mechanics, posture and kinesthetic awareness. Chronic conditions often stem from these issues; the body creates them in response to trauma to protect itself.  Addressing them alongside injury leads to improved health outcomes.

In his free time, Tim Practices May Thai and Lindy hop Swing Dance.

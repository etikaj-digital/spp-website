_*If you have physiotherapy extras on your private health insurance._

All clinical pilates treatments, including classes, are delivered by a physiotherapist and can be claimed as a physiotherapy service.

We require 24 hours notice for cancelling an appointment or a full fee will be charged.

We do not do home visits.
